Death sentences are worded like "shall be hanged by the neck *until dead*"
so people like this lawyer can't weasel out of their sentence if the
execution device fails. Since his head hasn't been separated from his body,
his sentence has not been carried out and he goes back into his cell until
the mechanism is fixed and they do it again.
